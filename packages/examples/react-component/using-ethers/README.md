# EVM Skeleton with Ethers

This skeleton app uses the Ethers library to create a simple app that can be used to interact with the Civic React Component to issue a pass.

It currently only supports the demo pass on Goerli, using the dev gatekeeper stage.

## Deployment

This is hosted on Vercel at https://multichain-evm-skeleton.vercel.app/
Deployment is done from your local machine with the Vercel CLI command `vercel`.
